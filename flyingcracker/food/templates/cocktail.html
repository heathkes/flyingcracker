            The flyingcracker staff is dedicated to providing you with recipes for high quality libations. Our selection criteria is simple: All drinks submitted must pass a rigorous multiple session taste test before they can be added. If we find a drink sufficiently delectable it gets added. If we yawn, or like the taste but never bother to mix it again, the drink is not added. If you have a suggestion for our drink list please email us: graham at flyingcracker dot com. Please drink responsibly.
